# GaCD_course_project
## Preparation

We are reading tables from both sets and merging them here.

## Our goal

Our goal dataset's columns has to contain every original column that is a mean or std of some parametr.

Our goal dataset's rows are 

* Participants from 1 to 30;
* Activities

In conclusion: we are getting mean data for every parametr that is mean or std for every participant and every activity.

## Column names

We need to clean our names using following principles:
* No braces, spaces or hyphons
* No useless word repetition
* I feel like going to lower case would cause difficulty, so I will skip that!

Detailed description for the features are in the "features_info.txt"

## Row names

Quite simple:

* Number for each person
* Name for each activity

**That's all!**
